# NLP_for_ScreenFail_prediction

This repository supports the medRxiv [preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.07.21249271v1) and the paper under submission entitled: "Natural language processing for patient selection in phase I/II oncology clinical trials", Delorme et al.

The tool aims at predicting the successful screening and dose-limiting toxicity period completion (SSD) from automatic analysis of consultation reports of patients with cancer. A random forest model uses frequencies of semantic clusters in a document to perform its predictions.
